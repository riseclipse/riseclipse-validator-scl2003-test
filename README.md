# RiseClipse Validators Test

This repository contains the necessary scripts (and data) required to test the consistency of the various RiseClipse validators.

## Requirements

To run the tests, you need to have the repositories of the validators that you want to test, and they need to be located next to the testing repository.

Do not change the names of the validator repositories when you clone them, as these names will be used by the testing scripts to locate the jars.

The validator repositories also need to contain the built jars for the validators, as this repository does not handle the build process.
